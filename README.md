## About CPSC 292 

This course is intended to be a first programming course in R for students with no previous experience in computer programming. The course will focus on becoming familiar and functional in the R language using RStudio. We'll learn about objects, data classes and structures, basic programming features (scripting, functions, and flow control), and basic plotting using ggplot2. By the end of the course, students will be able to create simple scripts in R focused on basic data analysis and plotting in a way that is reproducible and replicable. 

The Course Learning Objectives are: 
 1. Understand the basic structure and function of the R programming language.
 2. Understand and follow best practices in scientific computing.
 3. Independently create and perform basic data analysis and visualization in a way that communicates ideas clearly.
