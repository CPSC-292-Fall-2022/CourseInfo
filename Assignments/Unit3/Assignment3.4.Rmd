## Assignment 3.4

```{r, include=TRUE}

```

### Question 1

*In Assignment 3.2 question 1, you were asked to write a function that would take a number `x` and perform the calculation $2x^2 - 3x + 12$. Use a for loop to perform this calculation using the function you wrote to perform the calculation on 1,000 random numbers generated with `sample()`. Store the results of the function in an object called `hop.up3`.*

```{r, include=TRUE}

```

### Question 2

*In Assignment 2.1, you were asked to create a plot of the Loblolly data set that graphed height versus age, color the points by seed, and add lines that linked up the seeds. In base graphics (not ggplot), write a loop that adds these lines.*

```{r, include=TRUE}

```
